## Retro:

| Team Member   | Good Practices                                                                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alex Wan      | Good Communication between teammates and pacing, people are available               |
| Alex Yang     | We allocated based off what people were interested in, so we were more motivated    |
| Andy Phylim   | We had good communication between teammates and were able to adapt if needs changed |
| Cherie Kong   | We had good communication, and people were always available and willing to help     |
| Deon Li       | We had good communication, good environment and got code out pretty quickly         |
| Frank Chen    | Once tasks were assigned, code was written quickly                                  |
| Raymond Chen  | Positive work enviornment, we worked well together and communication was spot on    |

(Positive) Key Take Aways:
- The way that we've been talking to each other works. We should continue to use Discord as a hub to communicate and collaborate
    - Have people ping each other about when to work together in one of the chat rooms
- Everyone should continue to support each other when messages are pinged, and people are respectful of others time

| Team Member   | Bad Practices                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alex Wan      | Once off in different branches, people had their own way of doing things, need to standardize |
| Alex Yang     | We too often merged working branches together, rather than merging into sprint-1 and pulling, leading to merge issues |
| Andy Phylim   | We had a lot of code that was inconsistent in style, and front-end feels like it needs more meetings for UI |
| Cherie Kong   | We need more discussion on UI, taking wireframes and getting confirmation. Our code consistency was also not great this sprint |
| Deon Li       | We need to merge more often into a development branch, we should stop merging issue-# branches together |
| Frank Chen    | Some of our code wasn't as consistent as it should have been |
| Raymond Chen  | We change our mind alot, often mull over things alot. We need to be more decisive and interact with the client more |

(Negative) Key Take Aways:
- We should stop merging together issue-# branches and instead consistently push code into sprint-1 and pull
    - This way we don't keep asking people for portions of their code, they can take it from sprint-1
- Consistency regarding Functions vs Classes for React, we decided to go with Functions from now on
    - We'll stay consistent this way
- We should have more meetings about UI -> We could draw more quick wireframes in paint and ask if the general layout is fine
    - Maybe send more client emails about these UI changes to make sure they're onboard with it

Best/Worst Experience:
Everyone had the same answer 
- The best experience we had was when we finally got parts to work and when we got it all of it together.
- When we had to do all the merge conflicts and trying to check what was out dated was definitely the worst.

Things to be completed:
- These were things we started in Sprint-1, but did not complete:
    - Forgotten Password Option [51]
        - This was not in the acceptance criteria for the login stories, it was an optional subtask that we thought of
        - We'll put this as a low priority card
    - Email Confirmation Upon Signup [52]
        - This was not in the acceptance criteria for the signup stories, it was an optional subtask that we thought of
        - We'll put this as a low priority card
