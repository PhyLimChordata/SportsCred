| Team Member   | Good Practices                                                                                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alex Wan      | We've increased the rate that we can code, doing connections from front to back has been easier    |
| Alex Yang     | Sprint was pretty clean, low issues, standups are still fast                                       |
| Andy Phylim   | Sprint was done well, standups are being completed faster                                          |
| Cherie Kong   | Communication has still been good, we've kept everyone up to date despite the increase course work |
| Deon Li       | Communication has been good, everyone seems to be on the same page and can get help when needed    |
| Frank Chen    | Whole sprint was done well, we're becoming more used to working as a development team              |
| Raymond Chen  | The sprint had few problems, communication and resolving issues has become easier                  |

(Positive) Key Take Aways:
- Communication between teammates continues to be a strong point for our team, we should continue our practice of messaging on Discord
    - Have people ping each other about when to work together in one of the chat rooms
- We seem to be resolving issues faster, this is likely due to just having more experience working as a team
    - And working with the languages/tech
- Standups are no longer an issue for us, they're not slowing us down and are being done efficiently
    - A farcry away from what we had in sprint-1, so we have resolved this issue

| Team Member   | Bad Practices                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alex Wan      | There was still a bit of miscommunication regarding picks and predictions on what was assigned, though was cleared up |
| Alex Yang     | Lack of motivation is becoming a problem, even though we're finishing we don't have the energy we used to             |
| Andy Phylim   | Losing motivation as we go, need someway to reignite some passion and get excited again                               |
| Cherie Kong   | Personally had issues with time management and nearly caused delays                                                   |
| Deon Li       | Our morale has probably been at an all-time low, likely due to exhaustion from the semester                           |
| Frank Chen    | Struggling with motivation and willingness to write the code, even though it might not take long                      |
| Raymond Chen  | Team feels burnt out, and less interested in the project, more willing to work on other courses over this one         |

(Negative) Key Take Aways:
- Our team seems burnt out and no longer motivated
    - This is likely a result of the semester coming to a close and being exhausted from other courses
    - If this were a real workplace, would likely think of someway to raise morale
    - Team would also be able to take some vacation days at the very least to avoid burnout

Best/Worst Experience:
Everyone had the same answer 
- The best experience we had was when we finally got parts to work and when we got it all of it together.
- The exhaustion from the end of the semester is not something we appreciated and had to deal with

Things to be completed:
- We completed everything required for Sprint-4.
