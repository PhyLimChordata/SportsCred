## Retro:

| Team Member   | Good Practices                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alex Wan      | Standups are becoming more efficient, we're moving faster in terms of delivering code                            |
| Alex Yang     | Standups are beomcing shorter and cleaner                                                                        |
| Andy Phylim   | Standups are becoming more efficient, we're writing clearer goals, branching/merging has been more consistent    |
| Cherie Kong   | Communication was really smooth when it came to scheduling and discussing UI elements                            |
| Deon Li       | Communication continues to be a strong point for us, and we're branching/mering more cleanly, reducing conflicts |
| Frank Chen    | Communication was good this sprint, git has been cleaned up, less merge conflicts                                |
| Raymond Chen  | Communication was good this sprint, we're far more confident in merging our branches together without conflicts  |

(Positive) Key Take Aways:
- Communication between teammates continues to be a strong point for our team, we should continue our practice of messaging on Discord
    - Have people ping each other about when to work together in one of the chat rooms
- Everyone should continue to support each other when messages are pinged, and people are respectful of others time
- Standups are becoming faster and faster, we've sidelined discussions between teammates/specific coding problems that don't need the entire team's attention
    - We should continue to practice clean standups to make better use of everyone's time
- It seems that we learned from last sprint and made sure that we followed our merging strategy
    - We minimized conflicts (Only two files with unmeaningful issues from 5+ branches)
    - We should continue to use this strategy in order to midigate conflicts

| Team Member   | Bad Practices                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alex Wan      | Compared to sprint-1 we may have underestimated how time consuming these tasks were                   |
| Alex Yang     | Front-end seems to be overloaded, back-end doesn't do much after routes and models                    |
| Andy Phylim   | This sprint we overestimated our availabilities, we took on too much                                  |
| Cherie Kong   | We underestimated how much time other courses would pull from us, some of us had really bad schedules |
| Deon Li       | We overcommitted this sprint, as we actually didn't finish one of the userstories                     |
| Frank Chen    | Some of the way that we structured models (ACS) was not good                                          |
| Raymond Chen  | Individually, felt was unprepared for the swap from classes to functions in react                     |

(Negative) Key Take Aways:
- We overcommitted and had too many stories, we need to rethink how much time we have, especially next sprint
    - Everyone has 2-3+ midterms, we cannot take on too much, need to prioritize again what we should do
- Front-end continues to need more support
    - Both Frank & Deon will move to sudo-fullstack, where they'll handle request responses in react but not HTML/CSS

Best/Worst Experience:
Everyone had the same answer 
- The best experience we had was when we finally got parts to work and when we got it all of it together.
- When we had to do all the merge conflicts and trying to check what was out dated was definitely the worst.    
    - Though this time was way easier...

Things to be completed:
- These were things we started in Sprint-2, but did not complete:
    - Report Post Option [3]
        - This was the user story that we didn't start, we overestimated and unfortunately overcommitted this sprint
        - It was dropped due to it's required dependency, low priority and low estimation, it will appear next sprint
    - Match History [80]
        - This was an idea that we had, but didn't start and was not a part of the acceptance criteria
        - It will be a lower priority card and added to the backlog
    - Pagination of Posts/Focused Views [81]
        - This was an idea that we had, but didn't start and was not a part of the acceptance criteria
        - It will be a lower priority card and added to the backlog
