	How is your product different?

	This application is built toward sports fans who enjoy to debate topics of such interest.
	It provides additional features that help evaluate a person as an 'analyst' (trivia, picks,
	participation). As it does not focus on evaluating a person in one area, it places emphasis on many areas and
	helps to not only determine paragons of sports, but also differentiates everybody by their skill level. It is constantly
	testing a user so that they can never assume that they know everything and continuously refines their skills.
	This app encourages a person to always deepen their knowledge so that users are able to have more depth
	in discussion as well as have a more analytical approach to sports.

	Why do you think the competitors didnâ€™t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what
	would it take from them to do so?

	There has not been a focus as there is a lack of encouragement for users to have more analytical
	discussions. Most often users will have an opinion and generally think that they have a lot of knowledge in
	sports. There will be ways users will engaged in debates through posts on websites that are not geared towards
	serious discussions and lack a model to evaluate the value of such discussion. In order to get competitors to
	focus on this group there must be a platform that can provide a ranking or sorts that would encourage users to
	input more serious and logical discussions and can give values through a systematic way. Platforms that provide
	such rankings must also hold a certain amount of credibility as having a ranking on a website does not mean much
	if the system that evaluates is a simple or inadequate enough to fully value a user's contribution. There must also be
	value for scoring high in the platform. Currently the sports industry is based on interpersonal connections meaning that
	getting a job is not about what you know but who you know. To better encourage refining analytical skills rather than
	networking skills, the platform should be able to aid in obtaining such jobs so that competitors realize the value and
	will gear towards creating applications of such.
