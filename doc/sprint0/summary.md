SPORTSCRED - Summary


Objective:
The objective is to build a web application that allows for people to be more involved in sports, specifically the NBA. This application allows users to view game results, play sports related trivia both solely and versus, make picks and predictions, and have debates with other users. A forum which we’ll be calling the “open court” will also be included to create a community. A.C.S (analytical credibility score) will be used to quantitatively rank a user’s sports knowledge gained through using the application.


Key Users
* Casual: A user that uses the application from time to time. For example, during important games of the season, or the NBA finals. They may play solo trivia for fun during spare time and make picks/predictions during playoff time. This user will likely not participate in many debates, but may lurk in the open court.


* Enthusiast: A user that frequently uses the application multiple times throughout the day. They will constantly participate in debates and compete against others in trivia in order to farm A.C.S. They will want to make picks/predictions on a variety of categories.


* Admin: An user that ensures the application is fulfilling its objective and also moderates the application. This can include moderation in the open court and discussion in debates. They are there to ensure users are following the terms of service and respond to feedback.

Key Scenarios
1. Q is a huge NBA fan but he has no friends. However, Q really loves having discussions with people after a game, but the problem is he doesn’t have anyone to talk with. At school, all everyone talks about is Tik Tok. Q wants some way to have meaningful discussion and debates with other people.
2. M works a 9-5 job from Mondays to Fridays. He doesn’t have much time, but he watches a game here and there after an exhausting day at work. M takes the TTC to work and oftentimes his train is delayed. M wants something to do during his commute to work.


Key Principles
1. Functionality over Aesthetics - All features should meet functional requirements even if it may come at the cost of the overall aesthetics of the design
2. Quality over Quantity - Strive to ensure each feature is working as intended in a single category before attempting to expand the number for categories for features such as trivia and picks/predictions
3. Recognition rather than recall - Avoid overloading the user with information even if it comes at the cost of excluding certain elements on a page. Try to use objects such as icons rather than text, and keep text short if needed.
