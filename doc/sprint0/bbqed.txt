    Your mark: 1.9

    In project management, project objectives usually include specific and measurable indicators, such as budget, quality, and time to completion.
    In our case, maybe mention how much time should be spent and how close to the full product we are aiming at.
    Example: https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/project-objectives/

  - Key users have been identified clearly (max 2 marks) [0 marks: not at all, 1 mark = somewhat clearly, 2 marks = clearly]

  - Scenarios have been described clearly (max 2 marks) [0 marks: not at all, 1 mark = somewhat clearly, 2 marks = clearly]
    Your mark: 1.5

    0.5 deducted because the second scenario needs more details.
    Worth mentioning:
    Usage scenarios often contain more than when the user will use the app, but also how to use the app to achieve some goal.
    This is related to UX mockup too.
