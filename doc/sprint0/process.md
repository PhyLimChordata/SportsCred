Reflection on Team BBQED
========================

### **Roles in the team**
-------------------------
- The *current* role assignments are the following:
    | Role                                        | Members                       |
    | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
    | Backend [ Database (Mongo), Node.Js, etc. ] | Deon Li, Alex Wan, Frank Chen |
    | Frontend [ React.js, HTML, etc. ]           | Cherrie Fong, Alex Yang       |
    | Fullstack [ Everything ]                    | Andy Phylim, Raymond Chen     |
    |                                             |                               |
    (From team-contract.md)

    These roles were decided on a meeting on 2020-09-17 and were given based off interest and preference.
    Deon will be the designiated note taker for meetings as well.
    See team-contract.md to see how we decide who reviews before submission.

### **Deciding on the Project & Stack**
---------------------------------------

Meetings were called once we set up the team Discord server. A lot of things were done democratically. For an example, after the presentations of each of the projects, we got together and reviewed what we liked and what we didn't like about each project. After everyone added in something, we took a team vote, which resulted in a 7-0 vote to work on Sportcred.

Once the project was decided, we needed to decide what technologies we should include in the technology stack. Much of this was dependent on interest, as everyone wanted to learn something new in the course. Again, after discussion on pros (Experience, Novelty, Use in Industry) versus cons (Time dedicated to learning, Lack of Resources) between different stacks. In the end, we decided to to go with MERN. Though, we did briefly consider MySQL instead of Mongo. Since the stack had been decided, it was also expected that everyone attempt to learn as much as they could before sprint 0 finished and sprint 1 started.

### **How Meetings were done**
------------------------------

All meetings were done online through Discord after we set up the server. So far there have had 4 meetings, one for each week. We had issues with the first meeting due to scheduling, but we set up a Google Calendar and since then there have been no problems.
    - 2020-09-15: Used to introduce ourselves, discussed which project we liked, gathered information regarding teams.md, talked about potential tech stacks and Sprint 0 objectives
    - 2020-09-17: Confirmed that we would decide to work on SportCred, ensured team.md was commited, set-up standup times, decided roles/tech stack and assigned Sprint 0 objectives
    - 2020-09-22: Update on sprint 0 objectives - everyone took turns explaining what was done, and tried to clear roadblocks; swapped MySQL for MongoDB
    - 2020-09-27: Update on sprint 0 objectives - anyone who wasn't finished explained what was done, and tried to clear roadblocks; first meeting with TA, discussed user stories

Notes were taken by Deon, as he volunteered to be the designated note taker of meetings. Meeting minutes included action items, attendence, and notes about what happened during the meeting. Attendance was perfect for everyone.

Overall, meetings were effective. The democratic nature of the meetings ensured that everyone brought in topics to discuss and had a say in the decision making process.

### **User Stories and Product Decision Making**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We came up with 24 user stories after listening to the client and discussing among ourselves. Of the 24, there are about 6 that were extra features that we came up with. These extra features were to be considered optional and we put them at the lowest priority, something we would work on if we were working faster than intended. 

One thing scenario that we used was "If I was a user, what features would I use in order?". Login and sign-up were the first two things everyone wanted to do, making it a clear high priority story. Features that appeared later or would be better implemented after other features, were put in a lower priority (See examples). From the workshop with Sportcred, the clients also discussed the order that features should be implemented. This also influenced our decision making. Below are some examples of our thought process.

    Example 1: We decided to put sign-up and login as at our highest priority, since users can't access anything until they have an account. Client had this at the top of their list as well.

    Example 2: We decided to put things like open court discussion as a medium priority, since you would be required to login before you could write stuff on the open court. This should be done after the high priority feature of login. The feature was also in the middle of the client's list, making it clear to be medium priority.

    Example 3: We decided to put tutorial for the application to be the lowest priority. The feature was not mentioned by the clients in the presentation and before a tutorial could be made the other features taught in the tutorial must already be implemented. Thus, it was put in low priority even though it might be a feature that users would want to use second or third.

For a full list of our prioritized tickets, please see JIRA.

### **Going into the Next Phase**
---------------------------------

Overall, we worked well in sprint 0. Everyone had the opportunity to provide input and had a say in the decision making. We all completed our tasks and asked for help whenever we needed it.

One thing that we struggled with was contacting and working with the client. While we had some contact with the client, there could have been more invlovement. In the next phase, we'll be sure to add everyone on email chains on emails to the client, and try to establish more consistent contact with them.
